Made by StatiX Industries

##Name:
iBeaconDemo

##Synopsis:
This is a simple app that uses Estimote iBeacons to infer the device's location. This app displays relavent diagnostic data for the beacons such as the UUID, major and minor.

##Availability:
The App is only usable on iOS devices running the latest iOS 8 development beta SDK and all devices running it must support Bluetooth 4.0/BLE.

##Author(s):
StatiX Industries:
* Lead Programmer: Pan Ziyue
* Hardware Coordinator & Designer: Liaw Xiao Tao
* UI and Graphical Assets Designer: Christopher Kok

##Caveats:
* Due to iBeacon and API limitations, the data displayed for the distance may not be 100% accurate.
* You need to change the UUID and region ID inside the code if you want to test your own beacons.

##License:
No licenses yet

##Final Note:
Yes I wrote this thing in the format of a UNIX man(ual) page.
